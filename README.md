# YoutubeProject

This is a group project for the members of the FCCLadiesLounge group. We are using the Youtube API.

I have created a Trello board https://trello.com/b/t8fIxleC/youtube-api-project with objectives for the project, and we communicate via Slack. The project members are completely remote.
